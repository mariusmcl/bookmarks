This is my go at creating the transformer (encoder and/or decoder) architectures 'from scratch', and hopefully make it as intuitive as possible. There are other good resources

https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers

'Formal Algorithms for Transformers' -> https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238
    (This makes it much easier to understand, weird ppl dont frame things like this earlier....)


then we'll learn some 'language modelling' and things will be nice ;)
