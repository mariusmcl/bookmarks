2) Wont run b4 finished
3) Not unfair at all...
4) Increasing qsize increases the 'unfairness'. But: 
    - increasing qsize also increases schedtime, so
    - could be that the wall time is still better w/higher qsize
    - even though the difference in timestepscompletion is higher w/ bigger
    - qsize
