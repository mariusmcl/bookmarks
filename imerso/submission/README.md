The 'intersect' library provides functionality to ray-trace triangles. It provides the vec3 class to define points and vectors, together with the Ray and Triangle classes to define the ray-tracing problem. The intersect() function takes in a Ray and a Triangle, and checks if they intersect.

Tests can be run through typing 'make'
An example of using the library can be run by typing 'make example'
